# Q_rsqrtJS
##### This is a simple JavaScript implementation of the Fast inverse square root.

Fast inverse square root, sometimes referred to as Fast InvSqrt() or by the hexadecimal constant 0x5f3759df, is an algorithm that estimates 1/âˆšx, the reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of the square root of a 32-bit floating-point number x in IEEE 754 floating-point format.

The algorithm is best known for its implementation in the source code of Quake III Arena to compute angles of incidence and reflection of the light.
